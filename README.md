# Documentation Template

A over simplistic and minimal documentation template design made using HTML and CSS.
The template contains plain text and code blocks code included for reference.

## Purpose

Rather than coding a HTML and CSS skeleton from scratch its always easier to have a template to start from.
So vibe coded a Template using chatGPT. Though did modify the template just a bit.
